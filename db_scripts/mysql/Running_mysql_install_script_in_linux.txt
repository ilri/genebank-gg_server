The following are required to get the GG database up and running in mysql on a linux machine:

* mysql preinstalled
* TCP/IP enabled for mysql, port 3306 opened to server the GG Web Application will be installed on (GG web app currently does not work under linux)
* mysql_install_script.sql
* raw_data_files folder, containing various .txt files (for importing required data)

*** The mysql_install_script.sql needs to be manually edited before being run! ***

The mysql script itself is OS-agnostic, but it does contain LOAD DATA INFILE statements.
These require a full path to the .txt file being loaded since the path is relative to the mysqld process.

1. Move all files to a folder mysqld has access to (such as /tmp):
    mv gg_linux_mysql /tmp/gg_linux_mysql
2. Switch to the new folder:
    cd /tmp/gg_linux_mysql
3. Grant 'install' file to be executable:
    chmod +x install
4. Grant all data files to be world-readable:
    chmod a+r raw_data_files/
    chmod a+r raw_data_files/*.*
5. Run 'install' file (this will take a long time to complete):
    ./install
6. Test logins used by GG Web Application and GG Search Engine:
    mysql -ugg_user -pgg_user_passw0rd! --database gringlobal -e 'select * from sys_lang;'
    mysql -ugg_search -pgg_search_passw0rd! --database gringlobal -e 'select * from sys_lang;'
