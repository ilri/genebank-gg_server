How to manually install a SQL Server backup file for gringlobal

 1. Make sure you have all GG components installed.  If not, install them.

 4. Open SSMS
 5. Drop the "gringlobal" database
 6. Right-click "Databases" and choose "Restore Database..."
 7. Type in "gringlobal" in the "To database:" field
 8. Select "From device:" radio button
 9. Click the "..." button next to it
10. Locate the large .bak file from step 3
11. Put a check next to the first item under "Select the backup to restore"
12. Click OK
13. Go to windows explorer
14. Find the "drop_create_sql_users.sql" file
15. Double click it, should open in SSMS
16. Hit F5 to run it. Errors will display, ignore.
17. Hit F5 AGAIN to run it (to make sure the recreation worked, it may take 2 passes).  Errors will display, ignore.
18. The gringlobal database from the .bak file is now installed.
