Legend
==================================
CT = Curator Tool
SSMS = SQL Server Management Studio


Cannot login from CT to localhost
==================================
1. Attempt to view the local website.  http://localhost/gringlobal/
2. If you get a 404 error, an application besides IIS is probably using port 80.
3. Close that application
4. Restart the web server. To restart the web server:
     a. Open GRIN-Global Admin
     b. On the localhost connection (by default this is localhost\SQLExpress), right-click the Web Application node 
     c. Select Restart
5. In the CT, attempt to login again
6. Restart your application if need be


No rights to IIS Metabase
==================================
This occurs if the IIS user does not have appropriate rights to files that IIS requires.
Open a command prompt (with Administrator privileges on Vista / Windows 7) and execute the following statements:

cd c:\windows\microsoft.net\framework\v2.0.50727\
aspnet_regiis.exe -i
aspnet_regiis.exe -ga ASPNET


Cannot install database / database install does not seem to work
==================================
Open SSMS, if it throws an error with gringlobal.mdf (or something similar), the master database thinks a gringlobal database exists and it doesn't.  Fix:

1. Open SSMS, ignore error.  
2. Create a New Query, execute following SQL:
     drop database gringlobal
3. In GRIN-Global Updater, click Download / Install again and it should work.

Cannot install search engine - Service already exists
==================================
Previous uninstall of search engine failed at some point, even though it no longer reports being installed.
We need to manually delete the service before the installer to create a new one.
Open a command prompt (with Administrator privileges on Vista / Windows 7) and execute the following:

sc delete ggse

Cannot uninstall search engine - Invalid Parameter or Service does not exist
==================================
For some reason the Search Engine reports being installed, but the service itself does not exist.
We need to create a 'dummy' service so the uninstaller can find it and uninstall it.
Open a command prompt (with Administrator privileges on Vista / Windows 7) and execute the following -- EXACTLY as shown below (yes, that's a space after the equals sign):

sc create ggse binPath= C:\windows\notepad.exe


Updater does not seem to actually install anything when clicking Download / Install
==================================
The Updater may be incorrectly detecting the end of installations, and report them as completed (or wait for completion indefinitely).
In GRIN-Global Updater:
1.  Go to Tools | Options
2.  Go to Download Cache
3.  Click the blue link near the bottom of the form -- this will load Windows Explorer pointing to where the actual installer files are located.
4.  Open the "Server" or "Client" folder, whichever is appropriate.
5.  Navigate down the folders until you find the application you wish to install. NOTE: install in the same order they are displayed in GRIN-Global Updater for everything to install properly
6.  Run the .exe -- do NOT run the .msi directly.  The .exe prepares the environment the .msi requires to operate properly.


Cannot connect to server in Updater
==================================
You may need to use an HTTP proxy server.  To Configure this:
In GRIN-Global Updater:
1.  Go to Tools | Options
2.  Place a check next to "Use HTTP Proxy"
3.  Try connecting again.  If it fails, you may need to specify a custom http proxy.
4.  Also, you may need to specify "Ignore 417 errors" for some downlevel http proxy servers to function properly



Enable Save Changes that Affect Tables in SSMS
==================================
Go to: Tools | Options | Designers
Uncheck "Prevent saving changes that require table re-creation"
Click OK
