    <div>
        Regardless of how you launch an msi (via setup.exe bootstrapper, msiexec.exe 
        command line, or double-clicking .msi file), the actual installation process 
        runs under the SYSTEM user, not the currently logged in user. &nbsp;This is because 
        the msi file is simply handed off to the Windows Installer service. &nbsp;This also 
        means there is no way to cleanly wait for the msiexec.exe process to end, as it 
        returns immediately after handing off the msi to the service.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
    <div>
        <ol>
            <li>Poll all processes, find which one has the current msi name in the command line</li>
            <li>Wait for that process to finish</li>
            <li>There&#39;s a slim window where we may have checked for the process and it hadn&#39;t 
                yet handed it off to the service. &nbsp;There&#39;s a 5 second delay in the code to 
                minimize the chances of that happening.</li>

    </div>
    <div>
        It also means any code called by Custom Actions defined in the msi are also 
        running under the context of SYSTEM. &nbsp;Custom Action code cannot rely on 
        user-specific directories / registry keys / etc.&nbsp;</div>

    <div>
        We shell out to other programs to perform some of the setup steps. &nbsp;Even though 
        the installer service runs with elevated privileges, we still have to manually 
        elevate any processes we create. &nbsp;GrinGlobal.UAC (gguac.exe) is used for this. 
        &nbsp;On XP, gguac.exe effectively does nothing but just launch the given app.</div>

    <div>
        In VS.NET 2008, the default for msi generation changed from uninstalling the 
        previous installation of your app to NOT uninstalling it. &nbsp;There is no built-in 
        way to do this within VS.NET 2008, so we have to run a post-build event to tweak 
        the msi file itself after it is built.</div>

        <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large; ">Cannot Include a 
        64-bit binary in a 32-bit MSI</span></div>
    <div>
        An msi must be targeted as a 32-bit or 64-bit build. &nbsp;Since we are avoiding 
        having separate 32-bit and 64-bit builds for each msi (as .NET lets you target 
        &#39;AnyCPU&#39; for the actual dll&#39;s and exe&#39;s), we must have the msi target the lowest 
        common denominator, 32-bit. &nbsp;However, there is one small exe we must have that 
        explicitly targets 64-bit for installs to work on 64-bit operating systems. 
        &nbsp;VS.NET won&#39;t let you add a 64-bit binary in a 32-bit msi -- even if it has a 
        different file extension. &nbsp;So I basically bundled the exe into a cab file and 
        distribute the cab file. &nbsp;A custom action runs which expands the cab file at 
        install time, meaning we can effectively distribute 64-bit code in a 32-bit msi.</div>

        <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large; ">Our MSI&#39;s Run Under 
        The 32-bit Subsystem on 64-bit Operating Systems</span></div>
    <div>
        Since our msi&#39;s do target 32-bit, a 64-bit operating system sees this and runs 
        the msi under the 32-bit subsystem of the windows installer service. &nbsp;This means 
        registry redirection happens, and any code in custom actions will see only the 
        32-bit registry keys. &nbsp;Registry reflection is supposed to ensure everything 
        appears in the 32-bit registry keys as it does in the 64-bit keys. &nbsp;However, 
        this isn&#39;t true for SQL Server 2008 Express. &nbsp;Some vital keys do not show up in 
        the 32-bit section of the registry (under Wow6432Node). &nbsp;This means our 32-bit 
        code in the custom action cannot see them. &nbsp;The 64-bit exe I mentioned earlier 
        is used to see the 64-bit version of the registry. &nbsp;Since the exe is explicitly 
        targeted to run under 64-bit, the 64-bit version of the .NET framework is used 
        to load the portable executable (PE) image, and we end up with a full-fledged 
        64-bit executable that can see the 64-bit version of the registry keys. &nbsp;This is 
        handled implicitly by GrinGlobal.Core.Toolkit.GetRegSetting(), assuming it can 
        find the 64-bit exe (GrinGlobal.Utility64 namespace, in other words 
        ggutil64.exe).</div>

        Custom Actions Don&#39;t Work Well With Strong Names</span></div>
    <div>
        When trying to call a strongly-named assembly from a custom action, a versioning 
        error almost always happens -- but not always. &nbsp;I never did figure out why this 
        happens. &nbsp;None of our custom actions point to strongly-named assemblies now and 
        I no longer get versioning errors. &nbsp;Go figure.</div>

        <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large; ">Temp Path Isn&#39;t 
        Reliable</span></div>
    <divUsing the environment variable &quot;TEMP&quot; or &quot;TMP&quot; to get the temporary path does 
        always return a valid temporary path. &nbsp;However, some of the Microsoft tools we 
        use to do installation tasks (such as sysocmgr.exe) do not work with paths that 
        have spaces (even in the 8.3 format) or are not rooted on the C:\ drive. &nbsp;So 
        GrinGlobal.InstallHelper.Utility.GetTempDirectory() returns a hardcoded value of 
        C:\temp\gginst. &nbsp;This folder is created as needed.</div>

    <div>
        I do not know why (nor does anybody on google), but custom actions defined in 
        web application assemblies are never called. &nbsp;The code for the custom action 
        must be located in a &#39;normal&#39; assembly that is not part of a web application. 
        &nbsp;The custom action code for our web app is located at 
        GrinGlobal.InstallHelper.WebInstaller.cs</div>

    <div>
        When the updater updates itself, it actually downloads the msi then creates a 
        batch file to call msiexec.exe to do the uninstall / install. &nbsp;There is some 
        interesting timing issues there, as the executable must exit before the msi 
        tries to uninstall it. &nbsp;Luckily, the msi waits for the user to click &#39;Next&#39; 
        before it tries to remove it, and that typically provides plenty of time for the 
        Updater exe to exit.</div>

    <div>
        To compare what versions are currently installed (which is gotten from the 
        registry&#39;s Uninstall key) to what all is available on the server, I had to use 
        COM Interop to call the WindowsInstaller.Installer COM object. Of course, when 
        you touch COM via Interop all kinds of fun things happen. &nbsp;I ended up having to 
        actually call the following 3 lines of code to prevent file locking (I still 
        don&#39;t know exactly why it requires all 3 lines, but together they do the trick). 
        &nbsp;See GrinGlobal.InstallHelper.Utility.GetProductVersion() to see what I mean.</div>

    <div>
        Services cannot be upgraded without a reboot using a VS.NET 2008-generated installer msi.
		This is because the files are attempted to be replaced before the service is shutdown (meaning the files are locked).
		To circumvent this, Updater manually stops the GRIN-Global Search Engine service (ggse) before attempting to reinstall the Search Engine application.
		This work fine, but if the user runs the Search Engine's .msi or .exe, it will require a reboot before operating properly (but the installer does not prompt them to reboot, only informs them they should).
