# This is a sample AppSettings file used by the GRIN-Global Curator Tool application.
#
# This file contains settings used by the Curator Tool for customized behavior taylored 
# to the users needs.  Each entry should be kept on an individual line. 
# The setting name should be placed in the first column followed by an equal sign (=)
# and then followed by the corresponding value of that setting.
#
# Additionally, comments (such as these) may be inserted on individual
# lines denoted by a '#' symbol at the beginning of the line.

# Here are some example treeview friendly name formulas:
#
#      ORDER_REQUEST_ITEM_ID_NAME_FORMULA = {get_order_request_item.sequence_number} + " - " + {get_order_request_item.external_taxonomy}
#      TAXONOMY_SPECIES_ID_NAME_FORMULA = {get_taxonomy_species.name} + " - " + {get_taxonomy_species.name_authority}
#
#
# And here are some example treeview virtual node definitions:
#      TAXONOMY_GENUS_ID_VIRTUAL_NODE_DATAVIEW = get_taxonomy_species
#      CROP_ID_VIRTUAL_NODE_DATAVIEW = get_crop_trait
#
#
# And fianlly, here are some example misc. application setting definitions:
